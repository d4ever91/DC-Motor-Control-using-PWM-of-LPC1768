Here the Library PWM.C is used to configure all the PWM functions and ADC is used as per the previous tutorial.

PWM_Init( CHANNEL_NUM, cycle );

PWM_Set( CHANNEL_NUM, cycle, offset );

PWM_Start( CHANNEL_NUM );

These are the functions used for our application. Here CHANNEL NUM macro defines 1.

offset = adc_result/4;

The adc_result is divided by 4 to get the output from 0 to 1000 to the offset.

PWM_Set( CHANNEL_NUM, cycle, offset );

This is the function to set the PWM in the output pin.
