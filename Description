In most of the applications controlling the speed of DC motor is essential where the precision and protection are the essence. 
Here we will use the PWM technique to control the speed of the motor. 

LPC1768 has one PWM channel with six ports. PWM changes the average output voltage by fast switching. By changing the on time, the output voltage can be 0 to 100%. There are two software parameters that need a little explanation: cycle and offset. Cycle is the length of a PWM duty cycle and offset is the on time of a duty cycle.

For example: when the cycle time is 1000 and the offset:

0, the output voltage = 0%

255, the output voltage = 25.5%

1000, the output voltage = 100%

PWM REGISTERS:

The registers associated with LPC1768 ADC are

IR-> Interrupt Register: The IR can be written to clear interrupts. The IR can be read to identify which of eight possible interrupt sources are pending.

TCR-> Timer Control Register: The TCR is used to control the Timer Counter functions. The Timer Counter can be disabled or reset through the TCR.

PR- > Prescale Register: The TC is incremented every PR+1 cycles of PCLK.

MCR-> Match Control Register: The MCR is used to control if an interrupt is generated and if the TC is reset when a Match occurs.

MR0 â€“ MR6-> Match Register: Each can be enabled in the MCR to reset the TC, stop both the TC and PC, and/or generate an interrupt when it matches the TC.

PCR-> PWM Control Register: Enables PWM outputs and selects PWM channel types as either single edge or double edge controlled.

LCR-> Load Enable Register: Enables use of new PWM match values.
